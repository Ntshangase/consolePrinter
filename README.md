## Getting started

This is my MTN App Academy project.


run 'flutter doctor' if it's giving problems to see if your workspace is compatable with flutter.
To run this using Visual Studio Code, Open the file and the run/debug button pops-up then click run, and the result will show in debug console.
All these files are run differently/ function independently.
